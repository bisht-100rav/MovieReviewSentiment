Dear Manny/Augustas/Sushant Singh Rajput you did leave a mark, you left all your viewers speechless. Be it in the reel world or the real world. You were the most amazing character and I enjoyed you act, and sobbed at the same time, watching you smile and crack jokes made me so emotional. How could a person this cheerful with the brightest not with us anymore. This movie was very warm just the right mix of humor and drama and emotions. Its so fresh that one can re-watch it a 100 times and still wont get bored. I recommend it to all the people out their, because it is not just about cancer or just the regular teenage love story, it far more than that. Give it a watch and I'm sure you'll agree with me.
