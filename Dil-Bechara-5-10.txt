I dont want to put rating based on emotion. I Love SSR but this movie is certainly not his best. His emotion and acting looked a bit fabricated(actually a lot) I dont see any reason to give such high rating to this mediocre level movie. Its because it is his last movie, and we want justice for him doesnt mean we randomly give this movie a 10/10
